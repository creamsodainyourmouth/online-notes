It's Vue project representing online notes. Each note consists of a list of tasks, tasks can have different priorities; you can choose the color of the note. Tasks can be sorted alphabetically, by creation time, or by importance. As the tasks are completed, the motivating percentage of completion of the case will change.

Information about tasks and notes is stored in the browser's localStorage. So an excellent upgrade would be the ability to create an account and store information in the server's database.
